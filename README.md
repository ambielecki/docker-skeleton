# ambielecki/docker-skeleton

This is a simple starting point for connecting multiple web containers 
behind an nginx-proxy.

Clone this project in the root folder where your web projects are based

Register hosts (example.test) in your machines hosts file

This should work with xdebug as well, replace docker.for.win.localhost in the xdebug.ini if 
you are on a mac
